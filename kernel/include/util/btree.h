 * Branching factor determines certain bounds on the size of our tree as follows:
 * Let t be our branching factor.
 * Lower bound: each node has at least t-1 keys, at least t children
 * Upper bound: each node has at most 2t-1 keys, at most 2t children
 * Height of the tree is bound by log_t(n + 1) / 2 where n is the number of nodes
 * 
 * Change it as needed for performance

/*
 * btree_node is the core of our rough btree implementation here
 * - n_keys keeps track of the number of keys (out of the max 2t-1) we have on this node
 * - keys is the array of keys
 * - data is the array of addresses corresdoning to keys
 * - children is the array of children for this node
 * 
 * Note that keys and data are indexed the same. For the pageframe example, keys[i] is 
 * the pagenum of the i'th pageframe, and data[i] is the address of the i'th pageframe
 * where i is the index of the pageframe stored in this node. In this example, i has 
 * absoutely nothing to do with the pageframe's index in the mo_pframes linkedlist
