 *     object to o, checking to see if a copy doesn't already exist in o.
 *  3) Be careful with refcounting! In particular, when you put away o's
 *     shadowed object, its refcount should drop to 0, initiating its
 *     destruction (shadow_destructor).
 *  4) As a reminder, any refcounting done in shadow_collapse() must play nice
 *     with any refcounting done in shadow_destructor().
 *  5) Pay attention to mobj and pframe locking. You want the mobj locked when you
 *     are modifying its refcount!
 *  Something to keep in mind for this function is that there are several ways to do it
 *  but the general idea is the migration of pframes to the top mobj, which is
 *  always the one directly above the mobj you are checking the refcount of, and that you

 * Obtain the desired pframe from the given mobj, traversing its shadow chain if

 *  pagenum  - Number of the desired page relative to the object
 *  forwrite - Set if the caller wants to write to the pframe's data, clear if

 *        mobj that has the frame. Do not recurse! If the shadow chain is long,
 *        you will cause a kernel buffer overflow (e.g. from forkbomb).
