 * Because you are the one writing nearly all of the calls to namev_lookup(), it
 * is up to you both how you handle all inputs (i.e. dir or name is null,
 * namelen is 0), and whether namev_lookup() even gets called with a bad input.

/*
 * Parse path and return in `res_vnode` the vnode corresponding to the directory
 * containing the basename (last element) of path. `base` must not be locked on
 * entry or on return. `res_vnode` must not be locked on return. Return via `name`
 * and `namelen` the basename of path.
 *
 * Return 0 on success, or:
 *  - EINVAL: path refers to an empty string
 *  - Propagate errors from namev_lookup()
 *
 * Hints:
 *  - When *calling* namev_dir(), if it is unclear what to pass as the `base`, you
 *    should use `curproc->p_cwd` (think about why this makes sense).
 *  - `curproc` is a global variable that represents the current running process 
 *    (a proc_t struct), which has a field called p_cwd. 
 *  - The first parameter, base, is the vnode from which to start resolving
 *    path, unless path starts with a '/', in which case you should start at
 *    the root vnode, vfs_root_fs.fs_root.
 *  - Use namev_lookup() to handle each individual lookup. When looping, be
 *    careful about locking and refcounts, and make sure to clean up properly
 *    upon failure.
 *  - namev_lookup() should return with the found vnode unlocked, unless the
 *    found vnode is the same as the given directory (e.g. "/./."). Be mindful
 *    of this special case, and any locking/refcounting that comes with it.
 *  - When parsing the path, you do not need to implement hand-over-hand
 *    locking. That is, when calling `namev_lookup(dir, path, pathlen, &out)`,
 *    it is safe to put away and unlock dir before locking `out`.
 *  - You are encouraged to use namev_tokenize() to help parse path.  
 *  - Whether you're using the provided base or the root vnode, you will have
 *    to explicitly lock and reference your starting vnode before using it.
 *  - Don't allocate memory to return name. Just set name to point into the
 *    correct part of path.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *  - "/a/.././//b/ccc/" ==> res_vnode = vnode for b, name = "ccc/", namelen = 3
 *  - "tmp/..//." ==> res_vnode = base, name = ".", namelen = 1
 *  - "/dev/null" ==> rev_vnode = vnode for /dev, name = "null", namelen = 4
 * An additional note: namelen is used in conjunction with the string you set name to.
 * For example, you'll use functions like namev_lookup(), which through the pipeline, uses
 * strncmp to compare the first n letters in the name string (like "ccc/") to another string.
 * It's helpful to think about how namev_dir() gets used in other functions. Also, look at
 * ramfs_lookup() which gets called by namev_lookup() when you're doing VFS.
 * namev_lookup() --> ramfs_lookup() --> name_match() to see how name and namelen get used!
 * Therefore, name should be set to the last part of the path string.
 * 1.) a/b/c ==> name = c, namelen = 1
 * 2.) a/b/cc/ ==> name = cc/, namelen = 2
 * 3.) a/b/c//// ==> name = c////, namelen = 1
